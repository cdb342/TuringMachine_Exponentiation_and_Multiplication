# Implement exponentiation and multiplication using Turing Machine(The homework in NJUST)
##* Exponentiation
### Using a series of '1' to represent the base number and index number(For example, using 111 to represent 3).
### Using a standard Turing machine.
##* Multiplication
### Using binary numbers to represent the multiplier and the multiplicand.
### Using a four tracks Turing machine.
##* The file includes the program and transfer function.
